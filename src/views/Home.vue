    <h1>Something Like That</h1>
    <p>Something Like That is a 4 piece band with a penchant for harmonies, mash-ups, and jazzy sounds.  Although they primarily put their own twist on a variety of covers,  Janis Joplin to Black Street and everything in between, the band has been known to slip in an original song here and there.</p>
